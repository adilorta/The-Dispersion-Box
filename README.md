# The-Dispersion-Box
A free standalone tool - TheDispersionBox- to compute dispersion and attenuation curves in multi-layer viscoelastic orthotropic plates is connected to this publication (see (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.115779)).

TheDispersionBox contains different computational methods which can be selected by the user to compute guided wave dispersion behavior:

1. Matrix methods: global matrix, stiffness matrix, hybrid stiffness-compliance matrix
 
2. SAFE semi-analytical finite element method

3. LPM Legendre Polynomial Method

3. SDT 5th-order shear deformation theory

This toolbox is designed and created in Matlab 2021b.

App will download Matlab Runtime automatically. If you have any questions/comments/feedbacks, we would like to hear them!
