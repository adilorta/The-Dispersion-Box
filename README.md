# The-Dispersion-Box
This toolbox allows you to calculate the dispersion behavior of elastic/viscoelastic orthotropic multi-layered plates

This toolbox is designed and created in Matlab 2021b. Besides, it is a standalone app and it doesn't require any license.  

App will download Matlab Runtime automatically. If you have any questions/comments/feedbacks, we would like to hear them!
