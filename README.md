# The-Dispersion-Box
This toolbox allows you to calculate the dispersion behavior of elastic/viscoelastic orthotropic multi-layered materials

This toolbox is designed and created in Matlab 2021b. Besides, it is a standalone app and it doesn't require any license.  

App will download Matlab Runtime autamatically. If you have any questions/comments/feedbacks, we would like to hear them!

Soon, we will publish the theoretical background of the app with an article called "A comparative study for calculating dispersion curves in viscoelastic multi-layered plates".

We will share a short video of how to use this toolbox as well!
